Beware - the source code is perhaps more horrifying than the game itself!


Note: This version has had the blink timer disabled, and is meant for use with the HTC Vive Pro Eye (A VR headset with integrated eye tracking), vorpX for VR integration, and dgVoodo2, to help vorpX hook into SCP:CB successfully. The HTC Vive Part of this setup can be found here:

I believe I am the first person to use a VR headset with blink detection and SCP:CB that I can find. The experience is quite scary, and I highly recommend it for the SCP:CB enthusiast.
